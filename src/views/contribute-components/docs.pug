            p Thanks for wanting to contribute to Mathbook, we are always looking for more contributors.
              |  Now, before we get into the details of building a tutorial, let's first talk about the idea behind Mathbook which will help us define the purpose of our tutorials.
            p
              |  The idea behind Mathbook is a very simple one, which is 
              | to provide the world a free online resource to learn the 'What', 'Why' and 'How' on subjects in Mathematics.
            p
              | We can all work together to refine and make Mathbook a better resource for students.
            
            h3#know Things to Know
            p In order to start building a tutorial, you will need to have a GitHub account and knowledge of MathJax, HTML and CSS.
              | Every tutorial also requires a few core details that you will need to be provide along with the content (ie. exercises).
            p If you want to write a tutorial on a subject not (yet) listed in Mathbook, feel free to contact me at jgeorges371@gmail.com
              |  to discuss the details.
            p If and when your tutorial gets added to Mathbook, you will be added as a contributor to this project.

            .content
              p We break up every tutorial into three parts.
              ul
                li
                  a(href='#config') Configuration

                li 
                  a(href='#exercises') Exercises
              p Every tutorial follows a certain structure so the reader can expect a certain format for each tutorial regardless of subject.
              h5#config Configuration
              p The configuration part contains information like the title, table of contents, and a list of external resources for extra information.
