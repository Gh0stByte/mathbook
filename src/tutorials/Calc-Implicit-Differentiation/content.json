Implicit differentiation is finding the derivative of a statement one piece at a time, then finding the derivative of the whole. \n\n$$4x^2y + 2 y^2x = -7 $$\n\n$$ \\text {Let's look at what we've got. On the left side, the main rule which is being applied is a sum rule. The sum rule states that we can take the derivative of both sides}\n$$",
