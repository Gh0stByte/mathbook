        "text": "To give a little background on Limits and its origin, the concept of a limit was first introduced in the 1600's by Sir Isaac Newton. \n\nMathematicians practicing Calculus needed a way to determine the rate of change (\\(\\Delta\\)) between two points on a curve that were <i>infinitesimally</i> apart so that they could find the <i>Instantaneous Rate of Change</i>  <span class=\"has-text-grey\">(the rate of change at a point on a curve)</span>\n\nThus, came the introduction of Limits that helped determine that the \\(\\Delta\\) between two points that are infinitesimally apart could be determined as long as the points were on the same curve or were at least on an adjacent curve. This introduces another concept known as <i>Continuity</i>  which will be briefly discussed in another section.\n\nYou might find the concept itself a little tricky to understand at first, but with a little practice and time you will start to understand the concept and its purpose.\n\n"
